**Mad Libs** is a word game where one player prompts another for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story; these word substitutions have a humorous effect when
the resulting story is then read aloud.

This project is good for practicing dictionaries (one of the most important data structures), file handling, and string manipulation.
